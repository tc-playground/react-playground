# webpack

## Introduction

* `webpack` is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.

* `webpack` processes your application and  builds a dependency graph which maps every module a project needs and generates one or more `bundles`.

---

## Environment Variables

* `webpack` can be configured via a `.env` file placed at the root of the project.

    * Configure the source directory when looking for imports: `NODE_PATH=src/`

    > NB: Restart of server, test runners required for changes to take affect.
