# JSX

## Introduction

* `jsx` (JavaScript XML) is HTML embedded inside JavaScript.

* `jsx` needs to be `transpiled` into JavaScript.

* `jsx` is often used in `React` based applications.

## Notes

* `jsx` uses the HTML attribute `className` instead of `class` (to prevent clashes with HTML `class`).
