# Authentication and Authorization

## Introduction

* `authentication` or `authn` concerns establishing the `identity` of a user. For example, supplying a `username` and `password` to obtain an identifying `token`.

* `authorization` or `authz` concerns establishing the `capabilities` and `permissions` of an identified user.
